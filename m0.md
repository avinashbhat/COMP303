## M0 - Setup and Preparation

1. Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK)<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>. You can use eitther the latest [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/) or [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/). Note, you can only use Oracle JDK for personal use, e.g homework and personal productivity tools.
2. Download the latest JavaFX from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/). Scroll down the page to find "JavaFX YourOS SDK" from the latest release.
3. Clone the [Demo project](https://github.com/jin-guo/COMP303_CodeDemos) project into your Intellij workspace. In the Intellij IDE, click `File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> Git` and under URI enter `https://github.com/jin-guo/COMP303_CodeDemos.git`, then click-through.
4. Once imported, make the necessary changes to point to the location of JDK and JavaFX. For Java, right click on project -> Open Module Settings -> Project -> Project SDK -> New -> <Click on the downloaded JDK 19 folder>. For JavaFX, right click on project -> Open Module Settings -> Libraries -> + -> <Specify on the downloaded JavaFX 19 lib folder>
5. In case your JUnit setup is not ready, you can add JUnit 5 from Project Settings -> Libraries -> "+" -> From Maven -> Enter "org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.9.1" as query and locate the Junit.
6. If you have runtime error for JavaFX *"javafx components are missing"*, please add the VM option â€œ--module-path Your_JavaFX_lib_path --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml" in your configurations.

To ensure that everything works:

1. In the Demo project, in package `...m0.demo`, right-click on the file `Welcome.java` and select `Run 'Welcome.main()'`. You should see a small GUI application appear. Try the different buttons which should do the obvious thing.
2. Right-click on the file `TestAlternatingLabelProvider.java` and select ``Run 'TestAlternatingLabelProvider'``. You should see the message with tests passed.
3. Right-click again on the file `TestAlternatingLabelProvider.java` and select `Run 'TestAlternatingLabelProvider' with Coverage`. You should see a report showing coverage information.
4. Once everything works as described above, change line 37 of file `AlternatingLabelProvider.java` to return `aLabel1` instead of `aLabel2`, and re-run the test. The test should fail.


<a name="footnote1">1</a>: You can choose other version of JDK provided by different vendors, for example, Liberica JDK that already includes JavaFX (as reported in this [issue](https://github.com/jin-guo/COMP303/issues/1)). More inforamtion about how to chooose a JDK version can be found [here](https://whichjdk.com/).
