# COMP303 Software Design (Winter 2019)

## Course Description
This course provides an in-depth introduction to the discipline of software design for building realistic and high-quality software applications. It will focus on object-oriented programming techniques, and cover topics related to managing software complexity and verifying that they work as expected. It will use Java for all the code examples and assignments. However, the considerations during the design process apply in all languages for practical software development.

## Expected Outcome
After completing this course successful students should be able to:
* Properly explain and apply general Design Principles (separation of concerns, encapsulation, substitutability, interface segregation, etc.) and important Design patterns;
* Properly explain and apply design techniques such as UML Diagrams and Design by Contract;
* Effective use programming language mechanisms such as exception handling, concurrency and synchronization, reflection;
* Analyze and evaluate the quality of design solutions; correctly identify design smells and apply appropriate refactoring to eliminate them;
* Gain experience on software development tools such as modern IDEs (Eclipse), automatic documentation and testing tools (JUnit and JavaDoc) and version control system (Git).

## Prerequisites
COMP 206 and COMP 250

## Reference Material
* [Introduction to Software Design with Java](https://github.com/prmr/SoftwareDesign), by Martin Robillard, lecture note for COMP 303  
* [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-pragmatic-programmer/020161622X/) by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, Addison-Wesley, 2000.
* [Effective Java](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java-3rd/9780134686097/) by Joshua Bloch, 3rd ed., Addison-Wesley, 2017. If you aleady have the second edition, that is fine too.
 
While I recommend you buy physical books, the eBooks can be accessed following the instruction [here](http://mcgill.libanswers.com/ebooks/faq/200367).

* It’s important to attend the lectures in order to gain the best learning experience – it cannot be replaced by watching the videos afterward. 
* Our TAs will try their best to support your learning. But considering this is a big class – many of you will have similar questions or concerns and many of you have will answers to other people’s questions, we encourage you to discuss your questions about the lectures and exercises online. The participation during the class and the online discussion will count 10% of your final grades.
* Every lecture will come with assignments and exercises. Those are for your practice and will not be graded. Instead, your practical skills will be evaluated through lab tests that count 20% of your final grades.
* Missing any of the lab tests, midterm or final exam will result zero grade for that assessment.
* Any form of plagiarism, cheating is strictly banned during midterm or final exam. Integrity is crucial to this course and your future career. Any violation against academic integrity will be taken very seriously. For more information, please refer [here](https://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/academicrights/integrity).
